      summary: Create a new user account
      description: |
        Creates a new user account using the authenticated user's JWT token.
        The user ID (sub) is extracted from the JWT token, and a unique nickname must be provided.
        
        **Business Rules:**
        - User ID comes from JWT token (sub claim)
        - Nickname must be unique across all users
        - Nickname must follow validation rules (3-30 chars, lowercase letters + digits + single underscore)
        - Reserved words are not allowed as nicknames

        **Warning: This action cannot be undone!**
        
        **Data Cleanup:**
        - Removes user record from DynamoDB
        - Deletes all user photos from S3
        - Requires explicit confirmation via query parameter

        **Optional Deletion Reason:**
        While DELETE operations cannot have a request body per OpenAPI spec,
        the implementation optionally accepts a JSON body with deletion reason
        for audit purposes, though this is not documented here due to spec limitations.
